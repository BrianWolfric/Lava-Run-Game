<Strong> Lava Run Game </Strong>

An Obligatory free running game made using Phaser Framework as a part of my College Project. 
This is officially my first game made using Phaser. It was a great learning experience to work on phaser because i got to learn Javascript.


This game was made as part of learning how to make games in HTML5 and uses Phaser as the framework, original assets and
generated music. 

Feel free to use this game,its code and assets. Just do not be evil.
