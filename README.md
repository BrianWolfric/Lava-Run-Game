<Strong> Lava Run Game </Strong>

An Obligatory free running game made using Phaser Framework as a part of my College Project. 
This is officially my first game made using Phaser. It was a great learning experience to work on phaser because i got to learn Javascript.

This game was made using original assets and generated music. 

Feel free to use this game, its code and assets. Just do not be evil.
